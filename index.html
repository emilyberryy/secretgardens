                <h3><a href="#">About Last Week</a></h3>
                <p>Welcome to December! I’m coming off of my Thanksgiving break, which I know I appreciated. The best thing about the holidays is reuniting with those you care about, whether that be family or friends. Being that I still live at home, for me it was friends. It was so nice to see my friends over the weekend. Jumping back into school (or work) for one last stretch before break is definitely a test of motivation. My highlight of the week has to be Black Friday. I ended up working a shift at my old job, Aerie, which was definitely packed on the 29th. However, it was so nice to see my old coworkers again. As busy and overwhelming as Black Friday can be, it's a fun day for sure. Coming up this week are finals, so it’s definitely time to focus. December can be a time when many are thinking about endings and new beginnings. As we all push through this last stretch before the holidays and the new year, it’s important to remember to take time to slow down too…</p>

                <h3><a href="#">November Recap</a></h3>
                <p>Somehow November is over and December is beginning. With that comes the end of Autumn as well. Here in Maine the season of snow has started too. This November went by way too quickly, but was well-lived. I started the month off strong driving down to visit my friend Lily at her college with a few of our other friends. I hadn’t seen her since August when she left for school, so it was so refreshing to see her again. Fast-forwarding, I visited one of my best friends Avery for her birthday as well this month. It was great to see her and celebrate her 20th together. In all honesty though, November consisted of a lot of homework and work-work. As the end of the semester looms, things begin to ramp up. I had a lot of projects due this month and loose ends to tie up before the semester comes to a close. Even still, there were many bright moments sprinkled in…</p>
