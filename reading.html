                <h3>Currently Reading: Where The Library Hides</h3>
                <p>Sequel to What The River Knows, Where The Library Hides follows Inez Olivera as she must decide her fate following her cousin’s murder, her mother’s betrayal, and her uncle’s ultimatum. Tío Ricardo has given Inez few options to acquire her inheritance, leaving her seemingly with one option: marrying his former employee Whitford Hayes. The question is, can she trust him? Set in 1885 and split between Egypt and Buenos Aires, Where The Library Hides is fantastical historical fiction that beautifully concludes the Secrets of the Nile duology.</p>
